# ArenaPoints
Calculates how many arena points you will get at the end of the week in WoW TBC Classic. This tool uses the new formula
which was introduced in Season 4 that gives more points per week.

Credit goes to *u/Finalbelle* from Reddit for publishing the new formula in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/us1cg5/tbc_arena_calculator_formula_updated_for_s4/).
